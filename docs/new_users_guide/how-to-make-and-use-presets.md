#### Making a Playlist

Once you've made some presets, you may want to automatically cycle through some of them. You can do that with playlists! And there's an easy to use playlist editor built in.

1. From the Presets menu click "Create playlist".

2. In the "New Playlist" menu, first enter a name in the box that says "Enter name...".  
    You can also enter a Quick load label, which can be up to two letters.  
    
    !!! info "If you enter a Quick load label, it will appear as a small circle at the top of the preset list for quick access/activation without scrolling!"

3. Under Playlist Entries there is a dropdown with all of your presets (and other playlists) listed.  
    Select the preset you would like to be first in the playlist.  
    Then you can set how long you want that preset to play for (Duration), and how long it takes to between this preset and the next preset.

4. Click the plus (+) button next to the Playlist entry you just configured, and repeat step 3 until you have all of the Playlist entries you want in your playlist.

5. After you've set all of the playlist entries you want, there are two options to control how the playlist behaves.  
    - The **Suffle** option, if enabled, will play your playlist entries in a random order.  
    If you do not enable the **Suffle** option, your playlist entries will play in the order listed.  
    - The **Repeat Indefinitely** option, if enabled, will start the playlist over once all playlist entries have been played.  
        - If you do not enable the **Repeat Indefinitely** option, two new options appear. The first is a **Repeat *X* times** option, which allows you to set a specific number of repeats (instead of having the playlist repeat forever).  
        - The other new option is **End preset:** which allows you to select which preset is played once all playlist entries have been played. **NOTE:** This does not have to be a preset that was in your playlist. You can select any preset you have configured. If you select *None* then whichever preset was played last from the playlist will continue after the playlist is done.  
    
    !!! info "If you do not enable the *Repeat Indefinitely* option, the number in the *Repeat* X *times* text box must be at least 1 (the playlist will only play once, without repeating). This number is how many times the playlist will play in total, not how many times it will repeat."

6. Make sure to enter a ID number in the **Save to ID** box.  
    Once you hit **Save playlist** you will see the list of all of your presets including your new playlist!  
    Notice the playlist has a special icon before the name.  
    Now you can click on your playlist to activate it, just like you would activate a preset.
