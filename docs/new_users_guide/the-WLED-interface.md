The timer button activates a timer that will slowly fade off your light over 60 minutes. The length of time and way it fades can be configured under LED Preferences.

##### Sync

This button is a quick way to toggle the WLED's built-in sync functionality (WLED UDP Sync).
By default the light you click the button from becomes the sender, and any other WLED lights on the same network will recieve brightness, color, and effect changes from the sender.

##### Peek

The ***Refresh button*** refreshes the info listed above it.  
The ***Close Info*** button closes the info overlay.  
The ***Instance List*** button shows all of the other WLED lights that have been auto-discovered by the light. You can click on the name of that instance to control it.  
The ***Reboot WLED*** is a fast and easy way to reboot your WLED light.
