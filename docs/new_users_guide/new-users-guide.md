### The New Users Guide

This section of the knowledge base is written for an end-users perspective. It is specifically not a DIY-perspective.
This section is for people who use WLED, and less for people who make their own WLED projects (although it will likely still be helpful for those making their own WLED projects).

This section is intended to have no technical jargon and be easy for anyone to read and understand how WLED works, and how to use it.
